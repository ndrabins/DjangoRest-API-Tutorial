# DjangoRest-API-Tutorial
This is all the code from the Django Rest API Tutorial found here http://www.django-rest-framework.org/

I'm going through this tutorial as I seek to better understand making REST API endpoints with Django. My end goal is to be able to create a full on web app. I'm choosing to learn this as the next step because I want to use Reactjs on the front end.
